# TeamProfile

I would like to present code from project I have been working on. This code in the link represents a REST controller for managing team profiles in a full stack web application. The skeleton code was generated using JHipster, which creates a SpringBoot on the backend and TypeScript on the frontend from a high level specification. This code was part of one of eight features within the project, the "TeamProfile" feature facilitates the self-management of team profiles, allowing teams to view project details, rate them, and provide feedback. The generated controller handles basic CRUD operations: creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting team profiles but without any sanity checks. The basis of the code was generated by JHipster and I look forward to explaining how this means more high quality code is delivered quickly. The code I added enforces constraints like teams cannot edit teams profiles unless they are a member and cannot comments unless they made the comment. Students use the JHipster tool on the module where I am also a teaching fellow.
